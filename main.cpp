/**
 * howMany()'s goal is to find the US population in one year from now. We are provided with a few bits of data.
a. There is a birth every 8 seconds
b. There is a death every 12 seconds
c. There is a new immigrant every 33 seconds

My function sets all these values to ints, as well as defines how many seconds are in a year. Using this data,
it calculates how many babies are born, people are killed, and immigrants have migrated into the US in a year.
Then it simply adds the births, immigrants, and current population, then subtracts the deaths, to find the
new population in a year.

/**
 * givenSec equals the amount of seconds, between 0-1000000, given.
 An if statement makes sure that numbers outside of this range won't work.
 The point of this function is to covert seconds into a day/hour/min/
 sec format. It does so with the following steps:
 -finds days, sets it to variable.
 -finds remainder of days, then converts to hours, sets it to variable.
 -finds remainder of hours, then converts to mins, sets it to variable.
 -finds remainder of mins, then converts to secs, sets it to variable.
 -outputs the variables along with a string of text to make it understandable.
 We have to find remainders because ints truncate.

 * This function is actually pretty simple.
 We were given an equation that converted Fahrenheit to Celsius,
 so I algebraically reversed it, then plugged it into the program.
 We're given Celsius (collected as int), and then it is put it into
 the equation, which the answer is set to a new int, the Fahrenheit
 variable. Then that variable is returned.
